## Description

Starting from Nest based tutorial from Auth0 I decided to compare various react based web stacks:

### Modern Full-Stack Development with Nest.js, React, TypeScript, and MongoDB

From a terminal, issue the following:

```bash
# development
$ brew tap mongodb/brew
$ brew install mongodb-community@4.2
$ brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
```
